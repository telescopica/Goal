1. Install aptana Studio
2. Go to Aptana Preferences > Pydev > Interpreter-python
3. Click "new". Manually pick a python interpreter. On OSX, choose /usr/bin/python. Click OK
4. Apatana will attempt to autoconfigure all needed libraries. Make sure django libraries are made available. On OSX these should be at '/Library/Python/2.x/site-packages'
